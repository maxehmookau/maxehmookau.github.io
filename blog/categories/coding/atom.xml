    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve lost count how many times over the last 12 months that I&rsquo;ve been told how it&rsquo;s done by people younger than me.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 22. So not old by any stretch of the imagination. I met a young lady (@thisisneena) at the NHS Hack Weekend in Cardiff last week. Members of the NHS come with problems they want solving and coders solve them. She came with her father (a surgeon), an idea, a strong vision and an early-stage prototype she&rsquo;d coded herself. She didn&rsquo;t worry herself about how it could be commercialised, whether someone was going to steal her idea or even the concept of a minimum viable product.</p>

<p>She did the four things that stand between an idea and execution:</p>

<ol>
<li>She found something she was interested in.</li>
<li>Found a problem.</li>
<li>Learnt the skills needed to fix it.</li>
<li>Just got on and <strong>solved the problem!</strong>
Her end goal was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/18/nhs-records-system-10bn">not to make a bucket of money</a> or tie the NHS in to some contract that meant she could retire at 17 on a beach somewhere. The end goal was to make people&rsquo;s lives better.</li>
</ol>

<p>With age brings experience, but don&rsquo;t let that overshadow all of the things that youth brings to the table. Excitement, enthusiasm, naivity (yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing in moderation), positivity and the overriding feeling of coding because it&rsquo;s fun!
With age also comes cynicism, the need to provide for ones family and to pay the bills. <strong>That&rsquo;s not neccessarily a bad thing</strong> (those who know me will attest to my overflowing levels of cynicism for one so young.) but we mustn&rsquo;t forget the long nights spent coding because our ICT teacher didn&rsquo;t know enough to teach us anything at school or the first time we put a website on geocities for the world to see and the excitement that brought us. (Unless it was just me?)</p>

<p>Remember, these kids are smart. <strong>Really</strong> smart. If you see a young coder who&rsquo;s learning, offer them work experience, offer to teach them a skill or invite them to a tech meetup. <strong>Just get them involved.</strong> They&rsquo;ll thank you for it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having only graduated in July 2012, my degree is still relatively fresh in my head. I studied Music Informatics at the University of Sussex. Though it turned out to be basically a Computer Science degree with a slight musical slant since it turned out I was better at coding than playing the piano. I&rsquo;m now a full-time software developer and I truly enjoy what I do, however, many (if not the majority) of the skills I use day-to-day were not directly taught to me during my degree. Here&rsquo;s a list of the things I use day to day that <strong>I did not learn as a direct result of my studies.</strong></p>

<h2>Did not learn</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version control using Git.</li>
<li>Test-driven development.</li>
<li>Testing at all, except for 30 minutes on how to use JUnit.</li>
<li>Any sort of full-stack web framework. (Rails, Django, etc.)</li>
<li>Collaborative working using Git and GitHub (or similar).</li>
<li>Deployment strategies.</li>
<li>Any sort of server administration.</li>
<li>Use of a tool such as Redmine or JIRA.</li>
<li>Anything to do with Agile. (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s contrast that with a list of the things I did learn.</p>

<h2>Did learn</h2>

<ul>
<li>XSLT, DTDs, AJAX (not using jQuery)</li>
<li>MATLAB</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Subversion</li>
<li>Waterfall methods</li>
<li>OpenCV</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul>


<p>See where I&rsquo;m going with this? Yeah, there&rsquo;s a couple of cool things on that list. Computer vision is awesome, but I learnt <em>so</em> few of the tools and techniques I use day-to-day. Knowing Git, TDD and being familar with some sort of Agile methodology is pretty much assumed these days, but in three years and after £10,000, I did not know them.</p>

<p>I took a module in my final year called &lsquo;Web Computing&rsquo;. I expected to learn about web frameworks, web apps, stuff that would be <em>useful</em> if I wanted to go in to a career in what I would describe as web computing. First lecture:</p>

<blockquote><p>Be aware that this course does not cover PHP, Rails, or anything like that&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>I remember that quote. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;or anything like that&rdquo;</em>, like full-stack frameworks were somehow a waste of time. That module covered XSLT, DTDs, XML, that sort of thing. I learnt very little in that course other than the fact that I did not enjoy it. If an API provides XML instead of JSON I shudder now. But JSON was not even mentioned. Just to remind you, this module was taken in 2011/2012. <strong>This is not a long time ago.</strong> Seems to me that if Universities are tasked with preparing students with the skills required of them by industry, in my experience, the university failed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be totally negative about my university experience. I enjoyed myself, made some friends, discovered some hobbies and I&rsquo;d do it all again. But in terms of my university experience preparing me for the workplace, I remain to be convinced that my student loan was worth it.</p>

    <id>http://maxehmookau.github.io/blog/2013/09/22/those-who-cant-do</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an old blog post I started writing about a month ago but never got a chance to finish it. I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everything I&rsquo;ve said in it but will post it here and hopefully build on it at a later date.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Those who can&rsquo;t do, teach. Those who can&rsquo;t teach, teach P.E.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not that I ever agreed with this statement (the first half of it anyway; I had some pretty dire P.E. teachers), but when put in the context of programming, never has a more untrue phrase been uttered. When I refer to programming in this post, I&rsquo;m talking about the process of solving a problem by writing code, not software development in its wider context.</p>

<p>My previous two posts have been comments/rants on the state of education and some school&rsquo;s totally inability to teach children how to program. This post seeks to actually provide some constructive ideas on what could be done about it by looking at how programming can be &lsquo;taught&rsquo;. Ask any Computer Science undergraduate <em>&ldquo;How did you get in to programming?&rdquo;</em>, and I guarantee that a tiny, tiny, minority will say <em>&ldquo;I learnt x language at school&rdquo;</em>. Those that do say that, will even more rarely have come from a comprehensive school background.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all very well to say we&rsquo;re going to address this, but &lsquo;coding&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t one skill that can be taught. It&rsquo;s a combination of skills ranging from critical thinking, problem solving and sometimes just a bit of dumb luck. Let&rsquo;s assume that we have a class of children, all of whom are fairly bright and posess good problem solving skills and all have an active interest in learning to code. <em>I realise this is a massive assumption, but you have to start somewhere, right?</em> <strong>What next?</strong></p>

<p>Starting from nothing, it&rsquo;s often very tempting to dive in to &lsquo;scripting&rsquo;. In other words, writing a set of commands in any language, executed one after another to achieve a task, like this:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<pre><code>x = 10
x + 100
output x
=&gt; 110
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Do line 1, line 2, line 3, get line 4&hellip;. etc.
This is the easiest type of coding to teach and the easiest to learn, despite this type of code being used almost <strong>never in practice</strong>. Unless you&rsquo;re an über-hipster writing all your code in some snazzy functional languauge, the majority of code these days is written in Object-Orientated Languages (OO) such as Java, Ruby, Objective-C and sometimes PHP.
I spent a lot of time at university discussing the pros and cons of teaching OOP to university-age students <em>first</em> instead of teaching them to script first and we largely agreed that using an &lsquo;objects first&rsquo; approach was generally a good thing, especially for the 18+ age group. Although this conclusion wasn&rsquo;t reached by all people in this group. I however, saw no reason why this should not be extended to younger kids. Explain coding to them as a way of expressing &lsquo;things&rsquo; as code, and you might be on to something.</p>

<p>Explain that we can create templates, take a car for example. All cars have a set of attributes, these attributes are the same, but their values are often different. Cars can also all do the same set of things: open the boot, get spray painted, go forward, but how they do it depends on their individual attributes.</p>

<p>```ruby A Car in pseudocode</p>

<pre><code>class Car
    var make
    var model
    var colour
    var no_of_doors

    function paint(new_colour)
        colour = new_colour
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>```ruby Using a Car in pseudocode</p>

<pre><code>car = new Car
car.make = 'Nissan'
car.model = 'Note'
car.colour = 'Blue'
car.no_of_doors = 5
car.paint('Orange')
car.colour
=&gt; 'Orange'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This may all seem very obvious, but to someone just learning how to program, this is a <strong>totally different thought process</strong> than the first example of &lsquo;scripting&rsquo;. You cannot expect someone who has grasped the ideas in the first example to automatically be able to understand the ideas presented in the second and third. However, those are the skills that are really used day-to-day by most programmers. So why would we teach kids anything else?</p>
