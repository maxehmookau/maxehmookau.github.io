    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my first proper software development job at nearly 2 years ago now and I have done one thing more than anything else:</p>

<p><strong>READ.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read books on development, code, business, agile, psychology and just being a better person. Some of the books were useless. Some were excellent and some I wish I had read while I was at university. Here&rsquo;s a list of the books I&rsquo;ve read in the last 2 years on relevant subjects with a few words on the ones that stood out.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0192803158/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Cryptography &ndash; A very short introduction.</a></strong> &ndash; A really <em>really</em> short introduction to how cryptography works. Loads of tech every day uses cryptography and most developers just take its functionality for granted. Knowing, even just a little bit, about the theory can set you apart.</p></li>

<p><strong><a href="https://leanpub.com/dealwithit">Deal With It: Attitude for Coders</a></strong> &ndash; Written by Gavin Davies (@gavd_uk), this book is a must-read for any developer, new or old. It&rsquo;s made up of lots of single page ideas, each one backed up by personal experience that makes it super-readable and really fun to read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a></strong> &ndash; This is <em>the</em> tutorial for all new Rails developers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be adding to this list over the next few days. Let me know which books you&rsquo;ve found most useful in the comments.</p>
